# Rigify Gamerig Extension


### Motivation
Exporting rigify rigs to game engines is often hard to archive.
The ungenerated rigify rigs also called **meta-rigs**, usually do quiet well in game engines.<br>

This add-on should make this export process easier, 
by providing an easy way to link animations from the generated rig to the meta-rig.
Doing so, you may want to use the meta-rig as deform-rig.
The generated-rig will serve as control-rig.

**Caution**<br>
This add-ons purposes is to link animations to meta-rigs for an easier export to game engines.
The add-on may not be useful if you plan to animate and render within blender.


### Usage

1. Select it's meta-rig in the 'Rigify Gamerig Extension' Panel.
2. Bake animations to your likings and directly stash them to the meta-rigs rna tracks.
3. Unlink the meta-rig when you are done.
4. Use the meta-rig as deform rig and export it to a game engine.
