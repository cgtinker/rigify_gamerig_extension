# Rigify Gamerig Extension


For more information, please read the [documentation](https://cgtinker.github.io/rigify_gamerig_extension/index.html).

### Concept:
Easily copy animation data from a generated rigify rig to it's metarig.
This way you may animate the generated rig and use the metarig as gamerig!

0. Select Generated Rigify Rig and navigate to it's object properties.
1. Select it's metarig in the 'Rigify Gamerig Extension' Panel.
2. Bake animations to your likings and directly stash them to rna tracks.
3. Unlink the metarig when you are done.
